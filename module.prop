description=Vazirmatn is a Persian/Arabic font project that started in 2015 under the name Vazir with the idea of a new simple and legible typeface suitable for web pages and applications. Thanks to DejaVu Sans font (v2.35) published in public domain there was a free software base to start the Vazir project. Although Vazir was a completely different typeface, still the original software was common. For the Latin glyphset, Vazirmatn is combined with Roboto.
